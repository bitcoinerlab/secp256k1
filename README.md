# Secp256k1

@bitcoinerlab/secp256k1 is a Javascript library for performing elliptic curve operations on the secp256k1 curve. It is designed to integrate into the [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs) and [BitcoinerLAB](https://bitcoinerlab.com) ecosystems and uses the audited [noble-secp256k1 library](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1), created by [Paul Miller](https://paulmillr.com/noble/).

 This library is compatible with environments that do not support WebAssembly, such as React Native.

## Features

- Compatible with BitcoinJS [ecpair](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/ecpair) and [bip32](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip32) Factory functions.
- Based on audited code [@noble/secp256k1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1).
- Can be used in environments that do not support WASM, such as React Native.
- Uses the same tests as [tiny-secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1).

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```
npm install @bitcoinerlab/secp256k1
```

## Usage

### API

This implementation follows the tiny-secp256k1 API. Please refer to [tiny-secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1#documentation) for documentation on the methods.

This method is not yet implemented: `xOnlyPointAddTweakCheck`. It is not used in ecpair or bip32, though.

### Examples

You can test the examples in this section using the online playground demo available at https://bitcoinerlab.com/modules/secp256k1.

```javascript
import ecc from '@bitcoinerlab/secp256k1';
import { BIP32Factory } from 'bip32';
import { ECPairFactory } from 'ecpair';
const BIP32 = BIP32Factory(ecc);
const ECPair = ECPairFactory(ecc);

const keyPair1 = ECPair.fromWIF(
  'KynD8ZKdViVo5W82oyxvE18BbG6nZPVQ8Td8hYbwU94RmyUALUik'
);
const node = BIP32.fromBase58(
  'xprv9s21ZrQH143K3QTDL4LXw2F7HEK3wJUD2nW2nRk4stbPy6cq3jPPqjiChkVvvNKmPGJxWUtg6LnF5kejMRNNU3TGtRBeJgk33yuGBxrMPHi'
);
```

### Usage with React Native

@noble/secp256k1 uses Javascript `BigInt`, which is fully supported in React Native on iOS. However, to use it on Android, you must make sure you use the Hermes Javascript Engine, available from [RN-0.70 release](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/510).
